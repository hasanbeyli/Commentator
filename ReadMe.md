- **Things can be improved**
    -  Api paths can be more precise.
    -  Responding error messages with more proper way such as creating Global Error Handler (Exceptions).
    -  Implement an endpoint to retrieve a specific user by ID.
    -  When attempting to retrieve a user that does not exist (prior to creation), return a clear response such as "User not found â€” please create the user first."
    -  When deleting a user, ensure all related articles and comments authored by that user are also removed. This can be achieved using cascade operations in JPA.
    -  Enhance the username update functionality so that if the provided userId does not exist, the service responds with a clear error message indicating that no such user exists.
    -  When deleting an article with associated comments, either:
    1) First remove the comments before deleting the article, and notify the client that the article had comments linked to it.
    2) Configure cascade delete so that associated comments are removed automatically when the article is deleted.
